        One Sunday afternoon Lilli goes to Patterson Park with her father and her new baby Maggie-Rose. There she meets the big football skabanga boys. They think that all children who wear hearing aids are stupid and canâ€™t do anything. But Lilli is a gitchy-gumee smart young lady, who is not at all afraid of them. Lilli saves her baby sister from being squashed by their football. Then she shows them a thing or two about how to score a goal, and she becomes the best, BEST football striker ever in the Patterson Pinkers Football Team. How about that!
